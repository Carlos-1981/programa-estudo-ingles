Can I just say how proud I am of the four of us?
We were such adults in there.
I think we should thank Bud for suggesting that we use an arbitrator.
Thank you, Bud. Jerry was the perfect choice, fair, sensitive, kind, and I think he brought out the best in us.
And now that the papers are signed...
Shut up, Sol.
We are in an elevator that is temporarily standing still.
Robert, say the word... we're stuck!
The word "stuck"? It's just a word, it's better than "trapped".
She's claustrophobic.
It's just anxiety, Grace. Why don't you tell your anxiety, "Hey there, anxiety, I'm not going to let you rule me."
Because my anxiety doesn't give a flying fuck!
Frankie: Let me be your Valium. I'm Frankie Valium.
I've got pot gummies. Eat this.
No, no! I need one, I need one. Me, me, me.
That's almost five years ago. - Was that Memorial Day?
Labor Day. - Labor Day.
Guys, where's the coffee? Communist cake is served.
It's better that we're doing this together.
Frankie: I thought they were going to Mitch's parents' for the weekend.
Everybody's coming here, it's Labor Day.
This is your Aunt Frankie. Does this little bumpkin have a name yet?
She works too hard, even weekends.
Nah, it's fine, Frankie. It's what she loves.
Mitch, stop. I'm not in labor. It's just Braxton-Hicks.
Mitch: Okay, I know, but just let me know.
I'm not going to spend another 37 hours at the hospital like we did with Macklin.
I may have sent an email to my boss about my boss in which I called him dumber than fuck.
And in your world, he would appreciate that email because...
Bud: I totally get that. It's just my feeling is don't be dumber than fuck.
Frankie: Squirt tops that don't squirt are... They're just tops, do you see my problem?
Frankie: It's a natural probiotic. The ancient Egyptians used it.
Robert: We dodged a bullet.
Robert: Can you imagine if we told them and your daughter and Mitch walked in?
Frankie: It's always a very tough month for her.
Sol: All right. Then let's look at December.
Brianna: My mother doesn't know I'm here. I told her I had a thing and I couldn't talk.
Mallory: After mowing down my mailbox, you proceeded to get out of your car and start shouting...
Robert: You don't have to point out to me that I hurt your mother!
You think it's all right to ignore us?!
Grace: You can't see me, you can't stop me.
What the... hell?
We're not moving!
That's okay, Grace. I'm sure it'll start up again in a second.
Can I help you?
No need to use that word yet.
Oh, God!
Hello, hello!
Calm down, please, Grace.
There's no air in here.
There is air!
Why isn't it going into my lungs?
Because my anxiety doesn't give a flying fuck!
Don't you have a Valium? You always carry Valium.
Then you should be fine.
I said I took two pills, not two handfuls.
No, no. Grace, look at me. Focus on me.
Who was also a singer in the '60's.
I need more air.
I need air.
We've got you!
Easy, easy.
God! There's less air down here.
I have to stand up. You all have to sit down.
Honey, are you having a panic attack?
Maybe, a little... A little bit.
You claustrophobic, too?
Actually, no.
Wait, didn't this happen once before?
I'm okay, I'm okay.
That weekend before he started at the firm.
Was that Memorial Day?
Labor Day.
Happy Labor Day weekend, union supporters.
For Cesar Chavez.
Don't you know anything about the labor movement in this country?
Guys, where's the coffee? Communist cake is served.
It's better that we're doing this together.
Just let me do the talking.
Sol, trust me.
Yoo-hoo, big, fat whale on the loose.
Hi, honey.
Hi, Mom.
Hi, kids.
Look at you, radiant, pregnant woman.
Hi.
Does this little bumpkin have a name yet?
She's not telling anyone. Believe me, I've tried.
Frankie?
All good ideas. Pool time for me.
I'm going to make you a big, fat smoothie.
She works too hard, even weekends.
I'm good with my life expectancy.
Better than I have felt in months.
I was feeling a little nauseous earlier then I swallowed some pool water.
How are the contractions?
Stop worrying.
I'm not going to spend another 37 hours at the hospital like we did with Macklin.
How was your big date last night?
It was good.
Yeah?
Yeah.
You still dating the Zumba instructor?
No. This one I met at a stop light.
Why is it that people are always getting the kids presents?
Oh, don't worry I got you something, too.
What the hell are you wearing?
I might.
I guess you can do whatever you want now that your daddy's the boss.
And your dad, too. It's the best gig ever.
How's your work going?
Okay. What happened?
Nothing!
I rest my case.
But you understand bosses don't like it when an underling calls them dumber than fuck.
It's just my feeling is don't be dumber than fuck.
Squirt tops that don't squirt are... They're just tops, do you see my problem?
Sorry, it's a pulse.
It's healthy and delicious. I don't want to bruise the chard.
She's not going to drink that.
Nobody's going to want to drink that.
It's a natural probiotic. The ancient Egyptians used it.
I've been disconnected.
Robert, we're lucky. We dodged a bullet.
I can't do the end of September. It's Rosh Hashanah.
Definitely, but Frankie's birthday is October 12th.
Thanksgiving. Forget it.
Sol, I know this isn't easy for you but we will never be together if we don't pick a day.
All right. Then let's look at December.
Oh... Frankie's mother died in December.
What is going on in here? You're supposed to be making the marinade.
We have another freezer?
Want to build a house?
The girls are here.
I swear we're forgetting something.
What are you doing?
You can't just walk in there. It's not your house anymore.
Hi! Hi.
Welcome.
Knock, knock!
Hi, Dad. Hi...
Coyote. Welcome.
Who would like some sparkling apple cider?
Mal, the bread crumbs are gluten-free.
Mal.
I am not engaging with you.
Let's go, everybody! Phones in the box.
Phones.
God, I thought you only did this at your house.
I need a drink or I need my phone.
Let's eat!
Did you steal my scissors?
Yes.
Well, can I have 'em back?
Will you stop trimming the rugs?
That's not bad.
What is it, an otter?
It's my fucking day.
Just egg whites, no yolk.
He's like a magician in the kitchen.
Do you think it's dry?
I think it's perfect, babe.
If you're looking for those cigarettes, I threw them out.
Shit. I'd give my good knee for a cigarette.
Me, too. I haven't had a cigarette since smoking was good for you.
Mallory.
I cannot deal with all of this right now.
I can't deal with that, and I can't deal with you.
I want drugs, too.
I'm sorry, but we're blended. We have to be civil.
No, I don't. I just came here to pee.
